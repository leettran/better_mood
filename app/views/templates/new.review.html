		<h2>Yay! You are in a better mood now!</h2>
		<p>You startedÂ by describing this event:</p>
		<p>{{ cbtEvent.description}}</p>

		<p>And you first had these feelings:</p>
		<ul>
			<li ng-repeat="feeling in cbtEvent.feelings">
				{{ feeling.name }}, intensity of {{ feeling.amountBefore }}
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You listed your automatic thoughts and spotted some distortions:</p>
		<ul ng-repeat="thought in cbtEvent.thoughts">
			<li>{{ thought.automaticThought }}</li>
			<li ng-repeat="distortion in thought.distortions">
				{{ distortion.name }}
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>And you were able to provide a rational alternative to each of those thoughts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li ng-repeat="thought in cbtEvent.thoughts">{{ thought.rationalThought }}</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Then you went back over your feelings to see how strongly you felt them after all this.</p>

		<ul>
			<li ng-repeat="feeling in cbtEvent.feelings">
				Now you feel {{ feeling.name }} at a {{ feeling.amountAfter }}. {{ feeling.amountBefore - feeling.amountAfter}} change!
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Do you feel better? Hurray!</p>
