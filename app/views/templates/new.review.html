<h2>Yay! You are in a better mood now!</h2>
<p>You startedÂ by describing this event:</p>
<p>{{ cbtEvent.description}}</p>

<p>And you first had these feelings:</p>
<ul>
	<li ng-repeat="feeling in cbtEvent.feelings">
		{{ feeling.name }}, intensity of {{ feeling.amountBefore }}
	</li>
</ul>

<p>You listed your automatic thoughts and spotted some distortions:</p>
<ul ng-repeat="thought in cbtEvent.thoughts">
	<li>{{ thought.automaticThought }}</li>
	<li ng-repeat="distortion in thought.distortions">
		{{ distortion.name }}
	</li>
</ul>

<p>And you were able to provide a rational alternative to each of those thoughts:</p>
<ul>
	<li ng-repeat="thought in cbtEvent.thoughts">{{ thought.rationalThought }}</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you went back over your feelings to see how strongly you felt them after all this.</p>

<ul>
	<li ng-repeat="feeling in cbtEvent.feelings">
		Now you feel {{ feeling.name }} at a {{ feeling.amountAfter }}. {{ feeling.amountBefore - feeling.amountAfter}} change!
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you feel better? Hurray!</p>
